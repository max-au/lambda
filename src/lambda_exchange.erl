%% @doc
%% Lambda exchange, matching orders from brokers. Started by an authority,
%%  and linked to authority.
%%
%% An exchange serves a single module.
%%  Exchange orders:
%%   - sell (broker, amount)
%%   - buy (broker,  amount)
%%
%%  Brokers send "sell" orders on server behalf. Broker is monitored by exchange
%%   if it has any outstanding order. Orders from disconnected brokers are
%%   immediately cancelled.
%%
%%
%% Exchange match algorithm considers:
%%  * capacity
%%  * failure domains
%%  * previous allocations
%%
%% Exchange is started by an authority, if it does not have enough exchanges
%%  already known. Authority stops locally running exchange if it sorts
%%  first in the list of all known peer authorities, and has enough other
%%  exchanges running for this module.
