%% Lambda exchange, matching orders from brokers. Started by an authority,
%%  and linked to authority.
%% Separated from authority to enable concurrency - an authority is connected
%%  to thousands of brokers, while exchange will be connected only to a small
%%  numbers of brokers.
%%
%% An exchange serves a single module.
%%  Exchange orders:
%%   - sell (broker, Amount, Meta)
%%   - buy (broker,  Amount, Meta)
%%
%%  Brokers send "sell" orders on server behalf. Broker is monitored by exchange
%%   if it has any outstanding order. Orders from disconnected brokers are
%%   immediately cancelled.
%%
%%
%% Exchange match algorithm considers:
%%  * capacity
%%  * failure domains [passed via meta, NOT IMPLEMENTED YET]
%%  * previous allocations [NOT IMPLEMENTED YET]
%%
%% Exchange is started by an authority, if it does not have enough exchanges
%%  already known. Authority stops locally running exchange if it sorts
%%  first in the list of all known peer authorities, and has enough other
%%  exchanges running for this module.
%%
%% Exchange message protocol:
%% * broker -> exchange: buy
%% * broker -> exchange: sell
%% * broker -> exchange: {'DOWN', ...}
