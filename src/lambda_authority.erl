%% Lambda authority: process keeping track of all connected brokers and
%%  other authorities. When a broker needs to find an exchange to trade
%%  a module, it sends 'exchange' query to all known authorities,
%%  and every authority responds with known list of exchanges.
%%
%% If authority does not have enough known exchanges, it will start one
%%  locally, provides that erlang:phash2({node(), Module}) of this
%%  authority process sorts below threshold from all known authorities.
%%
%% It is expected that all authorities are connected to each other,
%%  forming a full mesh between processes (and corresponding nodes).
%% Authority remembers connectivity information for all other authorities
%%  and attempts to re-discover lost authorities (but not brokers).
%%
%% When an authority discovers a peer, it also updates all known
%%  brokers with the new authority list (eventually making all brokers
%%  to be connected to all authorities, NB: this may be partitioned
%%  in the future).
%%
%% There is an initial bootstrapping process when authority does not
%%  know any other authority and needs to find some. This information
%%  can be fed to authority (or broker) via bootstrapping API.
%%
%% Authority message exchange protocol:
%% * authority -> authority:
%% * authority -> broker:
%% * broker -> authority:
%% * bootstrap -> authority: provide a mapping for bootstrapping
