%%  Lambda broker, matching client requests to servers.
%%  Broker operations:
%%   - sell (pid, scope, capacity) - a pid wants to sell capacity in scope
%%   - buy (pid, scope, capacity) - a pid wants to buy capacity in scope
%%
%%  Servers send "sell" orders when their capacity changes (e.g. when client
%%   disconnects, or there is manual capacity change). At any time server can
%%   cancel sell order (or disconnect, which triggers the cancellation).
%%  Servers are monitored for the entire duration.
%%
%%  Clients send "buy" orders, which can be fulfilled immediately, or put
%%   in the waiting orders (any client that has waiting order is monitored).
%%  When client order is fulfilled, broker stops monitoring the client.
%%  Client can cancel the order (or disconnect).
%%
%% A broker serves one (single) scope. Server updates all brokers when
%%  capacity changes (e.g. new client has connected).
%%
%% Redundancy: server publishes to all brokers serving a specific state.
%%  Client receives full or partial responses, and makes connections to
%%  servers.
%%
%% Broker match algorithm considers:
%%  * capacity
%%  * failure domains
%%  * previous allocations
