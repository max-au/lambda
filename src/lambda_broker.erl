%% Message exchange protocol:

%%  * server -> broker: {'DOWN', ...}
%%  * plb -> broker: {buy, Module, Buyer, Quantity}
%%  * broker -> plb: {order, Sellers}
%%  * plb -> broker: {'DOWN', ...}
%%  * exchange -> broker: remote exchange executes the order (fully or partially)
%%  * exchange -> broker: {'DOWN', ...}
%%  * authority -> broker: remote authority starts (connects)
%%  * authority -> broker: remote authority updates a list of exchanges for a module
%%  * broker -> exchange: {sell, ...}, {buy, ...}
